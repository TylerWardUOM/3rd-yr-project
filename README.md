# 3rd-yr-project

Goal: build a small haptic training interface for a (simulated first) robotic manipulator. Cheap-ish prototype: encoders + motor(s) pushing back, loop talks to a sim (start simple, upgrade later). Focus on feel + low latency more than pretty graphics.

Why: haptics help users learn manipulator control faster vs pure visuals; sim keeps hardware risk = zero early.
